This transit will prove best for sportsmen and politicians mainly, lawyers are also likely to get benefited by it.</p><p>Overall Saturn Transit 2020 is not bad for you, just some precautions and wisdom is required on your part.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>WEALTH</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Direct aspect of Saturn over the 6th house shows the need of loans in year 2020 and this may lead to good results because your investment will lead gains for you. Still I suggest you to control few things in your lifestyle and done go overboard with expenses.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Saturn transit 2020 shows some issues at Marriage front and there can be more delays in finding a partner for yourself. But have patience because 2021 will bring a good news for you.</p><p>&nbsp;If you are already married and then you can expect some difference in opinion with spouse, though they won't be large unless you have severe negative combinations for bad Marriage.</p><p>With parents this Transit will cause some drifts and you may have some arguments with your father, mother is going to remain supportive but still you need to understand and respect them as much as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>With siblings this transit don't have much impact and their life will be same like before. I don't see much changes in year 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>HEALTH</strong></p><p>Your health is going to see improvements and you may start going to gym now. There will be focus on improve your appearance and you will be giving your best in it.</p><p>Any ongoing health issue will find its cure but not right away, you do need to give your best efforts for this. Naturally, some expenditures are going to occur on account on health but at least you will be able to find the cure.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>REMEDIES</strong></p><p>Since this Transit of Saturn is not that supportive, you should read Shri Vishnu Sahasranamam whenever possible. This will help you to deal with the slowness of this transit in year 2020.</p></div>
